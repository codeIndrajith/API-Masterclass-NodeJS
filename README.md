# Node.js API Master Class

This project is a comprehensive Node.js API Master Class that covers key concepts and best practices for building robust, scalable APIs. It includes detailed explanations and practical implementations for HTTP, custom error handling, authentication, advanced queries with Mongoose, and more.

## Features

### 1. HTTP Basics
- **HTTP Intro**: Understanding HTTP methods, status codes, headers, and body structure.
- **Status Codes**: Standard status codes to indicate success or failure in API responses.

### 2. Custom Error Handling
- Implementing centralized error handling for cleaner and more manageable error responses.

### 3. Mongoose Queries & Advanced Features
- **Basic Queries**: How to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations with Mongoose.
- **Advanced Queries**: Pagination, filtering, limiting, and sorting data using Mongoose.
- **Mongoose Aggregates**: Implementing aggregation pipelines for complex data manipulations.

### 4. Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **User Roles and Permissions**: Role-based access control for users, publishers, and admins.
- **Authentication Features**: Forgot password, reset password functionalities, and secure user management.

### 5. Relationships & CRUD Operations
- **User-Admin Relationships**: Managing relationships between users and admins.
- **Admin CRUD Operations**: Complete CRUD operations for admin users.
- **Review Model**: Updating and deleting reviews using aggregation pipelines.

### 6. API Security
- Implementation of best security practices, including:
  - **Data validation and sanitization**: Protect against injection attacks.
  - **Rate limiting**: Prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests per user.
  - **Helmet**: Secure HTTP headers.

### 7. Deployment & API Documentation
- **Deployment**: Instructions for deploying the API to production environments.
- **API Documentation**: Documentation of API endpoints using tools like Postman or Swagger.
